# SpinGlass-RL: Graph Neural Reinforcement Learning for Spin Glass Ground States

**A bridge between many-body physics and NP-hard combinatorial optimization.**
This project explores the ground state of disordered spin systems (Â±J Ising spin glass) through **reinforcement learning with graph neural networks (GNNs)**, formulated as a **Max-Cut optimization problem**.

---

## Motivation

* Spin glass physics provides a natural testbed for **complex energy landscapes**.
* The ground state problem is equivalent to **NP-hard Max-Cut optimization**.
* We develop a **physics-aware RL framework** with GNN policies to learn scalable heuristics.
* Benchmarked against **Simulated Annealing (SA)**, **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)**, and optionally **QAOA** (quantum-inspired).

---

## Methodology

* **Formulation:** Ising Hamiltonian as cut cost.
* **RL Environment:** Sequential spin assignment with reward shaping \$r\_t = -\Delta H\$.
* **Policy:** Graph Neural Network (GCN/GIN) with actorâ€“critic (A2C).
* **Training:** Curriculum from small to large graphs, entropy regularization, early stopping.
* **Baselines:** SA (heuristic), ILP (exact for small graphs), QAOA (optional).
* **Evaluation:** Relative energy gap, scaling with graph size, and cross-topology transfer.

---

## Key Results

* **RL vs SA:** RL matches or outperforms SA on medium graphs.
* **RL vs ILP:** Relative gap < 5â€“10% for graphs up to \$n=128\$.
* **Scaling:** RL generalizes across graph sizes and topologies (ER, grid, 3-regular).
* **Post-processing:** Simple hill-climb refinement improves RL energy further.

Poster-ready figures are included in [`figs/`](./figs).
